//Difference between Proceduaral Oriented Programming and Object Oriented Programming

/*Procedural oriented programming and object oriented programming are two different approaches to programming, each with its own characterstics and principles. Here's a brief differentiation betweeen the two:

1. POP emphasizes procedures or functions as the primary building blocks of programs, wheras OOP emphasizes objects as the primary building blocks of programs.

2. In POP, data and functions are treated as seperate entities, while in OOP, data and functions are bundled together within objects.

3. POP typically follows a top-down approach, breaking down problems into smaller tasks, wheras OOP follows a bottom-up appoach, defining and modelling objects and their interactions.

4. Global data is heavily relied upon and can be accessed and modified by any function in POP, wheras encapsulation is promoted in OOP, hiding internal details and providing abstraction.

5. Finally, OOP supports inheritance, allowing classes to inherit properties and behaviour from other classes, promoting code reuse and modularity, which is not a characterstics of POP.
